## What's stackr

Stackr is my big project to manage visually docker container, but in order to achieve this i have to make some kind of proof of comcept first wich is why this will be a mini-stackr with only api endpoint and no view

## To-do List

I have 4 days to do it, approximatively 6 hours per day so 24h.
